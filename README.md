Etch-a-Sketch is a simple sketching web app where the user hovers thier mouse
to sketch on a frame. This project was done as an assignment while following 
through The Odin Project.

What I learned :
- How to dynamically create and insert elements onto the webpage
- Toggle classes to manipulate the behaviour of certain elements
